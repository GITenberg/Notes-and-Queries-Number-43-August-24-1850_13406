<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>NOTES AND QUERIES</h3>
<p>The history of books and periodicals of a similar character
ought to be the object of interest to the readers of this work. The
number of works in which answers have been given to proposed
questions is not small. Not to mention the <i>Spectator</i> and its
imitators, nor the class of almanacs which give riddles and
problems, nor mathematical periodicals of a more extensive
character,&mdash;though all these ought to be discussed in course
of time,&mdash;there yet remains a class of books in which general
questions proposed by the public are answered periodically, either
by the public or by the editors. Perhaps an account of one of these
may bring out others.</p>
<p>In 1736 and 1737 appeared the <i>Weekly Oracle; or, Universal
Library. Published by a Society of Gentlemen.</i> One folio sheet
was published weekly, usually ending in the middle of a sentence.
(Query. What is the technical name for this mode of publication? If
none, what ought to be?) I have one folio volume of seventy
numbers, at the end of which notice of suspension is given, with
prospect of revival in another form probably no more was published.
The introduction is an account of the editorial staff to wit, a
learned divine who "hath entered with so much discernment into the
true spirit of the schoolmen, especially Thomas Aquinas and Duns
Scotus, that he is qualified to resolve, to a hair's breadth, the
nicest cases of conscience." A physician who "knows, to a
mathematical point, the just tone and harmony of the risings
pulses...." A lawyer who "what he this day has proved to be a
contingent remainder, to-morrow he will with equal learning show
must operate as an executory devise or as a springing use." A
philosopher "able to give the true reason of all things, from the
composition of watches, to the raising of minced pies ... and who,
if he is closely questioned about the planner of squaring the
circle, or by what means the perpetual motion, or longitude, may be
discovered, we believe has honesty, and we are sure that he has
skill enough to say that he knows&mdash;nothing of the matter." A
moral philosopher who has "discovered a <i>perpetuum mobile</i> of
government." An eminent virtuoso who understands "what is the best
pickle to preserve a rattle-snake or an Egyptian mummy, better than
the nature of the government he lives under, or the economy and
welfare of himself and family." Lastly, a <i>man of mode</i>. "Him
the beaus and the ladies may consult in the affairs of love, dress,
and equipage."</p>
<p>There is a great deal of good answering to tolerably rational
questions, mixed with some attempts at humour, and other
eccentricities, and occasionally a freedom, both of question and
answer, by which we might, were it advisable, confirm the fact,
that the decorums of 1736 and of 1850 are two different things.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id=
"page194"></a>{194}</span>
<p>First, as an instance of a question and answer, which might do
as well (if the record be correct) for the present publication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. We read in our public papers of the Pope's Bull and the
Pope's Brief; pray, Gentlemen, what is the difference between
them?</p>
<p>"A. They differ much in the same manner as the Great Seal and
Privy Seal do here in England. The Bull being of the highest
authority where the papal power extends; the Brief is of less
authority. The Bull has a leaden seal upon silk affixed to the foot
of the instrument, as the wax under the Great Seal is to our
letters patent. The Brief has <i>sub annulo piscatoris</i> upon the
side."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Query. Is this answer complete and correct?</p>
<p>Now for another specimen:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Q. Wise Oracle show,</p>
<p class="i6">A good reason why,</p>
<p class="i4">When from tavern we <i>go</i>,</p>
<p class="i6">You're wel<i>come</i> they cry.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A. The reason is plain,</p>
<p class="i4">'Cause doubtful to know,</p>
<p class="i4">Till seeing their gain,</p>
<p class="i6">If you <i>came well</i> or no."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The following is an example of unanswerable refutation. To show
why a man has not one rib less than a woman, it is stated that
imperfections are not hereditary; as in the case of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, an honest sailor not far from Stepney,
who has but one arm, and who cannot walk himself without the
assistance of a wooden leg, and yet has a son, born some years
after the amputation of is own limbs, whom he has bred both a
fiddler and a dancing master."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more, not for the wretched play upon words, but because it
may make a new Query,&mdash;What does it all mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. Gentlemen, in the preamble to the late Earl of Oxford's
patent, I observed, 'And whom they have congratulated upon his
escape from the rage of a flagitious parricide.' I desire to know
by whom, at what time, and in what manner, the said parricide was
to have been committed.</p>
<p>"A. Was to have been! He actually was committed&mdash;to
Newgate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for some of the "NOTES AND QUEERIES" (as the word ought
to be spelt) of a century ago.</p>

<h3>COLLAR OF SS.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"All the ensigns and marks of honour appertaining</p>
<p>to persons of highest distinction, are
equestrian."&mdash;<i>Sabnasins</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The interest which attaches to this very ancient and
distinguished ensign of chivalrous honour will excuse the
introduction into your pages of a fuller dissertation upon the
subject than what appears in "NOTES AND QUERIES," Nos. 39. and 41.,
in answer to the several questions put by your correspondents B.
and [Greek: Ph].</p>
<p>After referring to the papers on the Collar of SS., and other
collars of livery, published a few years ago in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, and his intention to arrange them, and other
additional collections on the same subject, in the shape of a small
volume, MR. J.G. NICHOLS proceeds to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a direct answer to B.'s question, 'Is there any list of
persons who were honoured with that badge, (viz., the Collar of
SS.?)', I may reply, No. Persons were not, in fact, 'honoured with
the badge,' in the sense that persons are now decorated with stars,
crosses, or medals; but the livery collar was <i>assumed</i> by
parties holding a certain position. So far as can be ascertained,
these were either knights attached to the royal household or
service, who wore gold or gilt collars, or esquires in the like
position who wore silver collars."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the statute for the regulation of apparel, passed in the
2nd year of the reign of Henry IV., it is ordained that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All the sons of the king, dukes, earls, barons, and baronettes,
might use the livery of our Lord the King of his collar as well in
his absence as in his presence; and that all other knights and
esquires should use it only in the presence of the king and not in
his absence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The royal assent to this bill was accompanied with further
regulations, among which were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the dukes, earls, barons, and baronettes of the realm
might use the said livery in their counties and elsewhere; and that
knights and esquires might use the said livery in going from the
hostel of the king and returning, to it, always provided that they
did not use it in the counties and countries in which they resided
or sojourned."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the golden Collar of SS. was the undoubted badge or mark of
a knight (<i>chevalier, eques auratus seu ordo equestris</i>, for
these words respectively indicate the same grade or dignity of
knighthood) all our ancient heraldic writers allow. But, were it
otherwise, the extract from the statute above given shows that MR.
NICHOLS is incorrect in stating, 1st. That there is no list of
persons who were honoured with the collar of SS.; 2nd. That persons
were not honoured with the badge, in the sense that persons are now
decorated with stars, crosses, &amp;c.; 3rd. That the collar was
<i>assumed</i>; and, 4th. That the assumers were, "so far as can be
ascertained, knights holding a certain position,&mdash;such as
being attached to the royal household or service."</p>
<p>It is important to point out these four inaccuracies of MR.
NICHOLS' reply to B., because it is desirable that his forthcoming
volume should not be a heterogeneous collection of notices relating
to the Collar of SS., mixed up with observations that will only
serve the purpose of darkening knowledge upon the subject of which
he treats.</p>
<p>The Collar of SS. is found in great variety of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>{195}</span> shapes,
and at what precise time it became an ensign of equestrian nobility
no one can tell. Collars were worn at least so far back as the days
of Livy (<i>i.e.</i> the commencement of the Christian era); for he
recounts that Manlius having pulled off the collar of a Gaul, took
the name of <i>Torquatus</i>, and afterwards always wore the
collar. Such being the case, there is no room for doubting that
this ensign formed one of the ornaments of knighthood from the
period of that dignity's earliest introduction into England.</p>
<p>There is a notion, from the circumstance of "Soverayne" being
the favourite motto or impress of Henry IV., that the Collar of SS.
takes its name from the initial letter of that word; and the
introduction of the portcullis into the collar, which was the
device of the House of Lancaster, is also considered by some as
proof that the collar originated with that king. In the effigies,
however, of Henry IV. and his queen, Joan of Navarre, in the Chapel
of St. Thomas Becket, Canterbury Cathedral, the collar which
appears round the neck of the queen (there is none upon that of the
king) has no portcullis. And as to the derivations of the name of
the collar from "Soverayne," from St. Simplicius, from the martyrs
of Soissons (viz. St. Crespin and St. Crespinian, upon whose
anniversary the battle of Agincourt was fought), from the Countess
of Salisbury, of Garter notoriety, from the word "Souvenez" and,
lastly, from Seneschallus or Steward (which latter is MR. NICHOLS'
notion)&mdash;they may all be regarded as mere monkish or heraldic
gossip.</p>
<p>Nicholas Upton, one of our earliest heraldic writers, who was
present at the siege of Orleans in 1428, states,&mdash;"Rex etiam
scoeie dare solebat pro signo vel titulo suo unum COLLARIUM de
gormettis fremalibus equorum de auro vel argento;" whilst, in a
wood-cut engraving of the arms of a German, Herr Florian Waldauff,
of about the time of Albert Durer, are three collars, one of the
letters SS. linkings into each other, terminating in front with
portcullises. Put these notices together and they may be considered
sufficient to demolish the Lancastrian origin theory of the collar,
on the one hand, and to unfold the true source of the collar's
nomenclature on the other, viz. that it comes from the S-shaped
lever upon the bit of the bridle of the war steed.</p>
<p>To [Greek: Ph].'s question, "Who are the persons now privileged
to wear these collars?" MR. NICHOLS answers, "I believe the reply
must be confined to the judges, the Lord Mayor of London, the Lord
Mayor of Dublin, the kings and heralds of arms." The privilege of
wearing a Collar of SS., so far as the various persons enumerated
are concerned, is a mere official privilege, and can scarcely be
cited in reply to [Greek: Ph].'s interrogative, except upon the
principle, "Exceptio probat regulam." The persons now privileged to
wear the ancient golden Collar of SS. are the <i>equites
aurati</i>, or knights (chevaliers) in the British monarchy, a body
which includes all the hereditary order of baronets in England,
Scotland, and Ireland, with such of their eldest sons, being of
age, as choose to claim inauguration as knights. It is presumable
too that the Collar of SS. is also an incident of the minor degree
of knight bachelor (bas-chevalier seu miles-bachillarus); whilst
the silver Collar of SS. belongs to every head of a family of
ancient esquirage quality, bearing arms. It is true, the fashion of
wearing the collar, whether gold or silver, may be said to have
been in desuetude for centuries. But rights of blood never
prescribe; and there are strong grounds to believe that there will
again be a general revival of the use of such distinctions.</p>
<p>There are various other points bearing upon the subject of the
Collar of SS., upon which I wish to offer some remarks, and with
your permission I will return to the subject. I cannot, however,
conclude without observing, that it would much add to the value of
MR. NICHOLS' compilation if he would extend it so as to embrace a
description of the floreal coronet of knighthood, the belt of
honour, the helmet, scarf, ring, spars, &amp;c.,&mdash;all indeed,
that the words "ad recipiendum a nobis ARMA MILITARIA" implied in
the ancient proclamations for taking the order of knighthood. If
MR. NICHOLS, in addition to this, will show also wherein the
knights of this equestrian quality differed from such persons as
were distrained "ad se milites faciendos," he will solve a number
of knotty difficulties in heraldic literature, and will enable the
public generally to understand that there are many more chivalrous
rights and privileges inherent in the subject than what is dreamt
of in the philosophy either of the court at St. James's, or the
college on St. Bennet's Hill.</p>

<p>In Coleridge's second <i>Lay Sermon</i> (ed. 1839, p. 365.) the
passage&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id=
"page196"></a>{196}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>"What are you," (a philosopher was once asked), "in consequence
of your admiration of these abstruse speculations?" He answered;
"What I am, it does not become me to say; but what thousands are,
who despise them, and even pride themselves on their ignorance, I
see, and tremble."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a quotation from Schiller (<i>Werke</i>, vol. i., p. 414.

</div>
</div>
<p>In Appendix (B.) to Coleridge's first <i>Lay Sermon</i> (p.
276.), we read,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An age or nation may become free from certain prejudices,
beliefs, and superstitious practices, in two ways. It may have
really risen above them; or it may have fallen below them, and
become too bad for their continuance."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though not given as a quotation, this passage is no doubt
borrowed from Baader, as quoted by Archdeacon Hare in a note to his
<i>Sermons on the Mission of the Comforter</i>,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nations, like individuals, may get free and rid of certain
prejudices, beliefs, customs, abuses, &amp;c., in two ways. They
may really have risen above them, or they may have fallen below
them and become too bad for them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a volume of tracts (Class mark Gg. 5. 27.) in St. John's
College Library, Cambridge, is a copy of Nicolas Carr's edition of
the Olynthiacs and Philippics of Demosthenes, (4to. London, Henry
Denham 1571.). As Carr died before the work was published, his
friends wrote a number of commemorative pieces in Greek and Latin,
prose and verse, which are annexed to the volume. Amongst the rest,
Barth. Dodyngton wrote a copy of Greek elegiacs, and a Latin prose
epistle. On Dodyngton, Baker has written the following
note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Barthol. Dodyngtonus in Com. Middlesex. natus, admissus fuit
Discipulus Coll. Jo. pro Fundatrice an. 1548.&mdash;Idem admissus
Socius, Apr. 8, an. 1552.&mdash;Idem admissus Socius Senior, an.
1558.&mdash;Idem admissus Socius Major Coll. Trin. Oct. 29, an.
1580."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same volume is note on Cheke:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Joan. Cheke admissus Socius Coll. Jo. Cant., Mar. 26, an. 21.

interesting communication on the subject of that "power of

during certain lucid intervals before death&mdash;a reference to
Sir Henry Halford's <i>Essay on the [Greek: Kausos] of

is customary for funerals to be preceded by a female carrying bays,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id=

after a person when they wish him to succeed in what he is going
about. This custom is very prevalent in Norfolk whenever servants
are going in search of new places; and especially when they are
going to be married, a shoe is thrown after them as they proceed to
church.</p>
<p class="author">C.P.R.M.</p>
<p>Some years ago, when the vessels engaged in the Greenland
whale-fishery left Whitby, in Yorkshire, I observed the wives and

passed the pier-head. Query, What is the origin of this
practice?</p>
<p class="author">[Hebrew: T.A.]</p>
<p><i>Roasting Mice for Hooping-cough</i> is also very common in
Norfolk; but I am sorry to say that a more cruel superstitious
practice is sometimes inflicted on the little animal; for it is not
many years since I accidentally entered the kitchen in time to save
a poor little mouse from being hung up by the tail and roasted
alive, as the means of expelling the others of its race from the
house. I trust that this barbarous practice will soon be
forgotten.</p>
<p class="author">R.G.P.M.</p>
<p><i>The Story of Mr. Fox.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent F.L., who
has related the story of Sir Richard, surnamed Bloody, Baker, is,
doubtless, aware of a similar tale with which Mr. Blakeway
furnished my late friend James Boswell, and which the latter
observed "is perhaps one of the most happy illustrations of
Shakspeare that has appeared."&mdash;(Malone's <i>Shakspeare</i>,
vol. vii. pp. 20. 163.)</p>
<p>The two narratives of Bloody Baker and Mr. Fox are substantially
the same. Variations will naturally creep in when a story is
related by word of mouth; for instance, the admonition over the
chamber in Mr. Fox's house&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Be bold, be bold! but not too bold</p>
<p>Lest that your heart's blood should run cold."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is altogether of a more dignified character than the similar
warning given by the parrot, at p. 68. Each of these worthies,
Baker and Fox, is seen bringing into his house the corpse of a
murdered lady, whose hand falls into the lap of the concealed
visitor; but in Fox's story the ornament on the hand is a rich
bracelet, in Baker's a ring. The assassins are, in both stories,
invited to the visitor's house, and upon Fox <i>summary</i> justice
is inflicted.</p>
<p>It may be asked, if Baker was burned, how came he to have a tomb
with gloves, helmet, &amp;c., suspended over it in Cranbrook
Church? Such honour was not paid to a man of higher rank in
Salisbury Cathedral, a murderer also, who was hung, viz., Lord
Stourton. Dodsworth tells us that till about 1775, no chivalrous
emblems were suspended over the latter, but only a twisted wire,
with a noose, emblematic of the halter. Allow me to ask, What
instances have we of tombs or gravestones, as memorials of
individuals who have suffered at the <i>stake</i>, exclusive of
those monuments which in after times may have been raised in honour
of distinguished martyrs at the Reformation?</p>

<p><i>Rushbearing</i> (Vol. i., p 259.).&mdash;Wednesday, July 21,
1847, Grasmere Church was decorated with ribbons, which had some
reference to the rushbearing which had taken place on the preceding
Sunday.</p>
<p>It takes place at Ambleside one Sunday later.</p>
<p><i>Extract from Black's "Guide to the Lakes," p. 43.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An interesting ceremony takes place at Ambleside once every
year, which the stranger may think himself fortunate in seeing, not
so much for the mere sight itself, though that is pretty enough, as
for its being the vestige of a very ancient observance. The
ceremony alluded to is called Rushbearing. On the eve of the last
Sunday in July, the village girls walk in procession to the chapel
bearing garlands of flowers (formerly rushes), which are there
tastefully disposed. After service, the day following, these are
removed, and it is usual that a sermon, in allusion to the event,
be preached. This observance is probably as remote as the age of
Gregory IV., who is known to have recommended to the early
disseminators of Christianity in this country, that on the
anniversary of the dedication of churches wrested from the Pagans,
the converts should build themselves huts of the boughs of trees
about their churches, and celebrate the solemnities with religious
feasting. In former times, the rushes were spread upon the floor of
the sacred edifice, and the garlands remained until withered.
Possibly the practice of covering the floors of buildings with
rushes by way of protection against the damp earth, may have had
something to do with keeping the custom in existence, long after
the origin of the institution had been forgotten. The ceremony of
Rushbearing has now fallen into complete disuse, except in a few
secluded hamlets in Westmoreland, and in one or two other places in
the kingdom; nor can that disuse be much regretted, since what was
founded as a religious act, every where degenerated into an
occasion for unseemly revelry, in fact, into a sort of rustic
saturnalia. And yet, when we look at this remain of the olden time,
as observed at Ambleside, we are tempted to say with the
poet,&mdash;</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>WHO WROTE SHAKSPEARE'S HENRY VIII.?</h3>
<p>I had no sooner read the title of an essay in the current number
of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, "Who wrote Shakspeare's Henry
VIII.?" than I became aware that I had been anticipated in at least
the publication of a discovery I made three or four years ago, but
for the making known of which a favourable opportunity had not
occurred. The fact is, that I was anxious to arrive at a more
satisfactory conclusion than has yet presented itself to me, and a
paper on the subject commenced more than two years ago, I, with
this feeling, laid aside. My present object is to strengthen the
argument of the writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, by
recording the fact that I, having no communication with him, or
knowledge of him, even of his name, should have arrived at exactly
the same conclusion as his own. That conclusion is (should any of
your readers not have seen the article referred to), that Fletcher
has at least an equal claim with Shakspeare to the authorship of
<i>Henry VIII</i>.</p>
<p>In the unfinished paper to which I have alluded, having asked
how it was that, with so much to be learned personal to Shakspeare
from his works, our criticism was so limited, and having stated it
to be my intention to confine myself to the simple inquiry,
"<i>What did Shakspeare really write?</i>" I continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To those who consider the text as having been settled 'by
authority,' this question may seem superfluous; but, not to refer
to plays of very early date, in connection with which we could
bring forward facts that, we doubt not, would be considered
sufficiently startling; we now state it as our belief that a great
portion of the play of <i>Henry VIII</i>.&mdash;nay, more than
half, was <i>not</i> written by Shakspeare."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My intention now is not to enter into any argument in support of
this view, but to state the results, which will be shown in the
following extract from my note-book:</p>

<p>So far all is clear, and in this apportionment Mr. Urban's
correspondent and myself are agreed. My conviction here is as
complete as it is of my own identity. But beyond, at present, all
is dark; I cannot understand the arrangement; and I doubt if my
friend, who has treated the question with so much ability, is
altogether satisfied with his own explanation.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I would suggest one or two points for
consideration. In those parts which I have set down as
Shakspeare's, and in which this writer imagines he occasionally
detects "a third hand," does the metre differ materially from that
of Shakspeare's early plays?</p>
<p>It will be observed that, in Act iii., Scene 2., there are
<i>two</i> farewells, the second being a kind of amplification of
the first; both, however, being in the part which I ascribe to
Fletcher. Is it not probable that these were written at different
periods? And supposing Fletcher to have improved his part, might
there not originally have been a stronger analogy than now appears
between this play and the <i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>?</p>
<p>The more it is tested the brighter shines out the character of
Shakspeare. The flatteries of James and Elizabeth may now go
packing together. The following four lines which I have met with in
no other edition of Shakspeare than Mr. Collier's, are worth any
one of his plays for their personal value; they show how he could
evade a compliment with the enunciation of a general truth that yet
could be taken as a compliment by the person for whom it was
intended:</p>

as Gilbertus Textor, Godwinus Cocus, Rotbertus filius Siflet,
Rotbertus de Havena, I find that of "&AElig;dricus qui signa
fundebat." As this phrase is susceptible of several widely
different renderings, I shall be grateful to any of your ingenious
readers who will give me their opinions as to its actual meaning. I
may add that &AElig;dric was living about the year 1170, so that
the phrase can have no reference to events connected with the

Does it contain the celebrated words <i>Barbara, Celarent</i>,

than the dated ones. Of books with dates there is the exposition of
Petrus Hispanus by Joh. Versor, in 1473, and the
<i>Summul&aelig;</i> of Paulus Venetus, in 1474; the first I find

<p><i>Damasked Linen.</i>&mdash;I should feel obliged for any
information on the earliest specimen of tablecloths being
"damasked," and the history of that manufacture. I have lately had
shown me as "family curiosities" a beautiful "damask service" of
Flemish or Dutch work. The centre contained a representation of St.
George and the Dragon. The hero is attired in the costume of the
latter part of the seventeenth century (?), with it cocked hat and

<p>At each corner of the cloth and napkins is a representation of a
female figure kneeling on a rock, with clasped hands, with a lamb
by her side (Query, St. Agnes?) On the border, at the top and
bottom, St. George is figured in armour stabbing with a spear an
alligator; and then with a sword, in the act of killing a bear.</p>
<p>On the side borders, he is receiving the attack of a lion on his
arm, covered with a mantle; and then, with a raised sword, cutting
at the proboscis of an elephant. I have seen, also, an older
specimen, I think, of the same manufacture; the subject being the
"Bear and Ragged Staff," on alternate rows, with figures of
trumpeters. I know not if this subject is of sufficient interest
for your "Notes and Queries," but I trust you will make what use of
it you please.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF THE WORD "DELIGHTED."</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., pp. 113. 139.)</h4>
<p>Although Mr. Hickson's notion of the meaning of <i>delight</i>,
in the three passages of Shakspeare he has cited, is somewhat
startling, it was not to be summarily rejected without due
examination; and yet, from a tolerably extensive acquaintance with
old English phraseology, I fear I cannot flatter him with the
expectation of having it confirmed by instances from other
writers.</p>
<p>I believe that <i>lighted</i> is rather an unusual form to
express <i>lightened</i>, <i>disencumbered</i>, but that it was
sometimes used is apparent; for in Hutton's <i>Dictionary</i>,
1583, we have "Allevo, to make light, to light."&mdash;"Allevatus,
lifted up, <i>lighted</i>." And in the <i>Cambridge Dictionary</i>,
1594, "Allevatus, lifted up, <i>lighted</i>, raised, eased or
recovered." The use of the prefix <i>de</i> in the common instance
of <i>depart</i> for to <i>part</i>, <i>divide</i>, is noticed by
Mr. Hickson; and <i>demerits</i> was used for <i>merits</i> by many
of our old writers as well as Shakspeare. I find <i>decompound</i>
for <i>compound</i> in Heylyn's <i>Microcosmos</i>, 1627, p. 249.,
thus:&mdash;"The English language is a <i>decompound</i> of Dutch,
French, and Latin."</p>
<p>These instances may serve to show that it is not at all
improbable Shakspeare may have used <i>delighted</i> for
<i>lighted==lightened==freed from incumbrance</i>; and it must be
confessed that the sense and spirit of the passage in <i>Measure
for Measure</i> would be much improved by taking this view of
it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it certainly does appear that the poet uses
the termination <i>-ed</i> for <i>-ing</i>, in the passages cited
by Mr. Halliwell, where we have profess<i>ed</i> for
profess<i>ing</i>, becom<i>ed</i> for becom<i>ing</i>,
guil<i>ed</i> for guil<i>ing</i>, brood<i>ed</i> for
brood<i>ing</i>, and deform<i>ed</i> for deform<i>ing</i>: it was
not unreasonable, therefore, to conclude that he had done so in
these other instances, and that delight<i>ed</i> stood for
delight<i>ing</i>, and not for delight<i>ful</i>, as Mr. Halliwell
implies. How far the grammatical usages of the poet's time may have
authorised this has not yet been shown; but it appears also that
the converse is the case, and that he has used the termination
<i>-ing</i> for <i>-ed</i>; e.g. long<i>ing</i> for long<i>ed</i>,
all-obey<i>ing</i> for all-obey<i>ed</i>, discontent<i>ing</i> for
discontent<i>ed</i>, multiply<i>ing</i> for multipli<i>ed</i>,
unrecall<i>ing</i>, for unrecall<i>ed</i>. Dr. Crombie
(<i>Etymology and Syntax of the English language</i>, p. 150.)
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The participle in <i>ed</i> I consider to be perfectly
analogous to the participle in <i>ing</i>, and used like it in
either an active or passive sense, belonging, therefore, neither to
the one voice nor the other exclusively."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supposing for a moment that Shakspeare used delight<i>ed</i> for
delight<i>ing</i>, the sense of the passages would, I presume, be
in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, "the spirit affording delight;" in
<i>Othello</i>, "if virtue want no beauty affording delight;" in
<i>Cymbeline</i>, "the gifts delighting more from being delayed."
Here we have a simple, and, in the last two instances, I think, a
more satisfactory meaning than Mr. Hickson's sense of
<i>lightened</i>, <i>disencumbered</i>, affords, even could it be
more unquestionably established.</p>
<p>I have, however, met with a passage in Sir Philip Sidney's
<i>Arcadia</i> (ed. 1598, p. 294.) which might lead to a different
interpretation of <i>delighted</i> in these passages, and which
would not, perhaps, be less startling than that of Mr. Hickson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All this night (in despite of darknesse) he held his eyes open;
and in the morning, when the <i>delight</i> began to restore to
each body his colour, then with curtains bar'd he himselfe from the
enjoying of it; neither willing to feele the comfort of the day,
nor the ease of the night."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, <i>delight</i> is apparently used for <i>the return of
light</i>, and the prefix <i>de</i> is probably only intensive.
Now, presuming that Shakspeare also used <i>delighted</i> for
<i>lighted</i>, <i>illuminated</i> the passage in <i>Measure for
Measure</i> would bear this interpretation: "the delighted spirit,
i.e., the spirit <i>restored to light</i>," freed from "that dark
house in which it long was pent." In <i>Othello</i>, "if virtue
lack no delighted beauty," i.e. "<i>want not the light of
beauty</i>, your son-in-law shows far more fair than black." Here
the opposition between <i>light</i> and <i>black</i> is much in its
favour. In <i>Cymbeline</i>, I must confess it is not quite so
clear: "to make my gifts, by the dark uncertainty attendant upon
delay, more lustrous (delighted), more radiant when given," is not
more satisfactory than Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"
id="page201"></a>{201}</span> HICKSON'S interpretation of this
passage. But is it necessary that <i>delighted</i> should have the
same signification in all the three passages? I think not.</p>
<p>These are only suggestions, of course, but the passage from
Sidney is certainly curious, and, from the correct and careful
manner in which the book is printed, does not appear to be a
corruption. I have not seen the earlier editions. I have only
further to remark, that none of our old authorities favour DR.
KENNEDY'S suggestion, "that the word represents the Latin
participle <i>delectus</i>."</p>
<p>Since the above was written, Mr. HICKSON'S reply to MR.
HALLIWELL has reached me, upon which I have only to observe that he
will find <i>to guile</i> was used as a verb. Thus in Gower,
<i>Confessio Amantis</i>, fo. 135. ed. 1532:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"For often he that will begyle,</p>
<p>Is <i>gyled</i> with the same gyle,</p>
<p>And thus the gyler is begyled."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We most probably had the word from the old French
<i>Guiller</i>=tromper, and the proverb is to the
purpose:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Qui croit de <i>Guiller</i> Guillot, Guillot le Guile."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Horne Tooke's fanciful etymology cannot be sustained. MR.
HICKSON'S explanation of "guiled shore," is, however, countenanced
by the following passage in <i>Tarquin and Lucrece</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"To me came Tarquin armed, so <i>beguil'd</i></p>
<p>With outward honesty, but yet defil'd</p>
<p>With inward vice."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>MR. HICKSON has, I think, conferred a singular favour in calling
attention to these perplexing passages in our great poet and these
remarks, like his own, are merely intended as hints which may serve
to elicit the <i>true</i> interpretation.</p>

<h3>FAMILY OF LOVE.</h3>
<p>I do not know whether the following Notes on "The Family of
Love" will be deserving a place in the pages of "NOTES AND
QUERIES;" as I may possibly have been anticipated in much of what I
send.</p>
<p>The Family of Love attracted notice as early as 1575, but not in
such a manner as to call for direct coercion. An apology was
published for them, from which it might be inferred that they
possessed no distinct opinions, but merely bound themselves to a
more exalted interpretation of Christian duties, on the principle
of imitating the great love of God manifested in their creation and
retention. This principle, unrestrained by any confession of faith
or system of discipline, naturally attracted to it the loose and
irregular spirits that were at that time so prevalent, and the sect
became the receptacle for every variety of opinion and disorder,
exposing itself to more particular notice from its contempt for
outward observances, and its opposition to the civil government.
The <i>Evangelium Regni</i> of Henry Nicholas, the acknowledged
founder of the sect, is written in such a manner as to include all
religious persuasions, and permits all parties to hold whatever
sentiments they please, if they merely declare themselves
<i>members of the Family of Love</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Omnes vos, O amatores veritatis! qui amabilem vitam charitatis
diligitis vocatmini et invitamini." (cap. 41.) ... "Omnes peribunt,
qui extra Christum extra communionem charitatis manent."
(Ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A confutation of this sect was written in the year 1579; the
privy council called upon the convocation of the year 1580 to
notice it. We find the sect still described in the publications of
1641, and continuing under the same name with its preachers and
congregations in 1645.</p>
<p>Bp. Cooper, in speaking of the sect in 1589 (<i>Admonition,
&amp;c.</i>, p. 146.), terms them "that peevish faction of the
'Familie of Love,' which have been breeding in this realm the space
of these thirty years."</p>
<p>Fuller (<i>Ch. Hist.</i>, 17th cent., p. 610.) says that in his
time "they had obtained the name of Ranters."</p>
<p>Leslie, in his <i>Works</i> (vol. ii. p. 609.), considers the
sect "identical with that of the Quakers."</p>
<p>That this was not the case is evident, I conceive, from George
Fox, the father of the Quakers, having severely chastised this
"Family of Love," because they would take an oath, dance, sing, and
be cheerful. See Sewel's <i>History of the Quakers</i>, iii. p. 88,
89, 344.</p>
<p>The founder of the sect, Henry Nicolai, was born at Munster, and
commenced his career about 1546 in the Netherlands; thence he
passed over to England, in the latter years of Edward VI.'s life,
and joined the Dutch congregation. But his sect did not become
visible till some time in the reign of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>In 1575 they presented a confession of their faith to
parliament, along with a number of their books, and prayed
toleration.</p>
<p>Nicolai, or Nicolas, their founder, published a number of tracts
and letters in Dutch for the edification of his followers: and now
I will propose a Query, in hopes that some of your correspondents
will solve it. Is there extant any list of their writings as
presented to parliament in 1575, and has their confession been
published, and when? Perhaps the following works, none of which I
am able to consult, would furnish the means of solving my Query,
all of which treat of the subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>J. Hombeck's <i>Summa Controversiarum.</i> Godfr. Arnold's
<i>Kirchen- und Kitzer-historie.</i> Ant. Wilh. Bohm's <i>Englische
Reformations-historie.</i> Schroekh's <i>Kirchengesch. seit der
Reformation.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id=
"page202"></a>{202}</span>
<p>These sources would, I conceive, be useful to N.B., who inquires
into their tenets and lives.</p>
<p>I find I have omitted to mention one of their assailants, "the
last and most learned," Henry More, the English divine. See his
<i>Mystery of Godliness</i>, book vi., chap. 12-18.</p>
<p class="author">[Hebrew: SP'T]</p>
<p><i>The Family of Love.</i>&mdash;In addition to the work of John
Rogers, referred to by DR. RIMBAULT (Vol. ii., p. 49.), the two
following treatises, which were also published in the year 1579,
will present your readers with much curious information respecting
the "Family of Love." The first is entitled,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Confutation of certaine Articles delivered unto the Familye
of Loue, with the exposition of Theophilus, a supposed elder in the
sayd Familye, upon the same Articles, by William Wilkinson, Maister
of Artes, and student of Divinitye, &amp;c. &amp;c. At London:
Printed by John Daye, dwelling ouer Aldersgate, Au. 1579."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <i>Epistle Dedicatorie</i>, dated Cambridge, September
30, 1579, and addressed to Richard (Cox), Bishop of Ely, the author
describes the new doctrine as,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The most pestiferous and deadly Heresie of all others, because
there is not almost any one particular erroneous and schismaticall
phantasie, whereof the <i>Familie of Loue</i> hath not borrowed one
braunche or other thereof, to peece vnto themselves this their
Religion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A passage is then added which may serve in some measure as a
reply to N.B. (Vol. ii., p. 89.) It seems to slow that, however
vile might be the theology of this sect, their morals were not at
least publicly offensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The encrease of this <i>Familie</i> is great, and that dayly,
because the withstanders are not many; the defenders are wily as
serpentes, and would fayne in lyfe seeme innocent and vnblameable.
In profession of the one they boast very much: of the other they
walkyng very closely do iustifie themselues, because fewe haue to
finde fault with them, yet haue they their lothsome spottes and
ougly deformities, as in this booke to the diligent reader playnely
may appeare."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "lothsome spottes" here intended are the 13th and 14th
articles of Wilkinson's indictment. They run as follows;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1.) "H.N. (i.e. Henry Nicholas) saith, It is lawfull for one of
his Familie to dissemble," (i.e., to conceal his religion when
questioned by the magistrate); and (2.) "H.N. maketh God the Author
of sinne, and the sinner guiltless," (but no proof is alleged that
this speculative impiety was carried out into actual life).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title of the second treatise to which I alluded
is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Confutation of monstrous and horrible Heresies, taught by
H.N., and embraced of a number who call themselves the Familie of
Love, by I. Knewstub. Imprinted in London, at the Three Cranes in
the Vinctree, by Thomas Dawson, for Richard Sergies. 1579."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He characterises the doctrine of the "Familists" as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A masse or packe of Poperie, Arianisme, Anabaptisme, and
Libertinisme. Respecting their morals we are told, that although
for their loosenesse of life, they are from the toppe to the toe
nothing but blottes, yet bragge they of all perfection, euen vnto a
verie deifying of themselues."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some further light is thrown upon this point by a letter sent to
Knewstub from a "godly learned man, W.C." He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Howsoeuer, they seduce some goodly and zealous men and women of
honest and godly conuersation, placing them at the porch of their
synagogue to make a shewe of holinesse, and to stand there as
baites and stalles to deceiue others; yet, alas! who can without
blushing vtter the shame that is committed in the inwarde roomes,
and as it were in the heart of that synagogue of Satan."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appended to Knewstub's book is a further&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Confutation of the doctrine of Dauid George, and H.N., the
father of the Familie of Loue, by M. Martyn Micronius, minister of
the woorde in the Dutche Churche, at London."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was originally written in Latin during the reign of Edward
VI. The author charges the "Familists" with maintaining
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Idolatry, superstition, and outwarde vices are free and pure
vnto them, which, vnder the pretence of a certaine fayth and
inwarde puritie, boast that they knowe no sinne in the heart." (Fo.
87 b.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two features particularly distinguish them from other sectaries
of the age: they professed obedience to the civil magistrate,
whatever might be his religion; and they argued in favour of
unlimited toleration both in regard to themselves and others.</p>

<h3>TRANSLATION OF THE PHILOBIBLON.</h3>
<p>L.S. (Vol. ii, p. 153.) inquires for a "translation of Robert de
Bury's <i>Philobiblon</i>." An English version of this famous
treatise by Richard, not Robert Aungerville (see, for the surname,
Pits, p. 467.) de Bury, Bishop of Durham in 1333, was published by
Mr. Rodd in the year 1832. The translator has not given his name,
but he was Mr. John Bellingham Inglis, formerly a partner in the
house of Inglis, Ellis, and Co. It is greatly to be desired that
there should be a careful reprint of this most interesting work,
and that the first edition of 1473 should be collated with MSS. The
translation by Mr. Inglis might be revised, and made to accompany
the Latin text. Let us hope, however, that his notes, if they be
permitted again to appear, may be purified from scepticism and
profaneness.</p>
<p>The claim of Holcot to be the author of this tract, should be
well considered and decided upon; <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> and the errors of the
learned Fabricius (who had a manuscript copy in which the writer
was styled "Muiegervile", instead of Aungerville), which have been
repeated by Mansi, should be corrected. Dr. James, the first
Bodleian librarian, fell into a strange mistake when he imagined
that his inaccurate reprint at Oxford, in 1599, was the
<i>second</i> edition of this treatise. It was in reality the
<i>fourth</i>, having been preceded by the impressions, Colon.
1473; Spir&aelig;, 1483; and Paris, 1500. So far as I remember, the
editio princeps has not been specified by Gough. (<i>Brit.
Topog</i>. ii. 121.)</p>
<p class="author">R.G.</p>
<p>I find I can answer the Query of L.S. (Vol. ii., p. l53.), who
asks, "Where can I procure a <i>translation</i> of Robert de Bury's
<i>Philobiblon</i>?"</p>
<p>A translation was published by Mr. Rodd, in 1832, of which the
following is the title:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Philobiblon: a Treatise on the Love of Books, by Richard de
Bury, Bishop of Durham, written in MCCCXLIV; and translated from
the first Edition, MCCCCLXXIII, with some Collations. London:
Printed for Thomas Rodd, 2 Great Newport Street, Leicester Square,
1832."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This translation is a small 8vo. volume, of which there is a
copy in the Douce collection in the Bodleian; at the beginning of
which copy, on a fly-leaf, the words, "J.B. Inglis to his friend F.
Douce, Esq.," are written; and opposite, on the inside of the
cover, there is written in pencil, apparently in Douce's own hand,
"I had read the MS. of this work before it was printed."</p>
<p>There appears to have existed some difference of opinion with
respect to the authorship of the <i>Philobiblon</i>. Leland, in his
<i>Itinerary</i>, ed. 8vo. Oxford 1744, vol. iii. pp. 77, 78, sub
loc. <i>Saresbyri</i>, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ex tabella in Sacello S. Mari&aelig;. Orate pro anima Ricbardi
Poure, quondam Sarum Episcopi." ...</p>
<p>"Qui quidem Richardus Episcopus postea translatus fuit ad
Episcopatum Dunelmensem ... Incipit Prologus in Philobiblon
Richardi Dunelmensis Episcopi, <i>quem librum compilavit Robertus
Holcot</i> de Ord. Pr&aelig;dicatorum <i>sub nomine dicti
Episcopi</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, however, in the appendix to vol. iv. of the
<i>Itinerary</i>, p. 164., it is said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Richardus de <i>Bury</i>, alias <i>Angravyle</i> dictus, episc.
Dunelm., scripsit Philobiblon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon Leland's authority, the Bodleian catalogue ascribes the
work in question to Robertus Holcot. Watt, however (<i>Bibl.
Brit.</i>), seems to imagine R. de Bury and Holcot to be the same
person. His words are (vol. i. c. 176 ):&mdash;"Bury, Richard.
Dunelm., <i>alias</i> Robertus Holcot, Bishop of Durham, and
Chancellor and Treasurer of England, in the reign of Edward III.;"
and again, under Holcot's name, "Holcot, Robert, <i>or</i> Richard
D. Bury."</p>
<p>The translator (J.B. Inglis) distinguishes in his Preface
between these contemporary writers, and considers R. de Bury to be
the undoubted author of this work passing under his name. In
corroboration of his opinion, Mr. Inglis refers to the
<i>Biographical and Retrospective Miscellany</i>; and, in order to
prove that the work was finished in the author's lifetime, he
produces the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Quod opus (Philobiblon) Aucklandi&aelig; in habitatione sua
complevit, 24 die Januarii, anno a communis salutis origine 1344,
&aelig;tatis su&aelig; 58, et 11 su&aelig; pontificatus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He died 14 April, 1345. Holcot died in 1349."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There appears to be some confusion about the <i>editions</i>,
also, of the <i>Philobiblon</i>. There is an edition, 4to. Par.,
apud Gaspar. Philippum, 1500; also edit. <i>secund</i>. 4to.
Oxoni&aelig;, 1598; and it is printed in the <i>Philolog. Epist. ex
Bibl. Melch. Goldasti</i>, ed. Lipsi&aelig;, 1674. But prior to all
these is the edition "printed at Cologne, 1473," from which the
<i>translation</i> is made, and which is described by Watt as "the
editio princeps, and a work of uncommon rarity."</p>
<p>Query. Why does the Oxford edition of 1598 call itself "editio
<i>secundo</i>?" If the Paris edit. of 1500 so far differ from that
of 1473 as to entitle it to be considered a different work, had the
second MS. passed through Holcot's hands?</p>
<p class="author">J. SANSOM.</p>
<p>The translation of Richard de Bury's <i>Philobiblon</i>, by Mr.
Inglis, printed in 1832 for the late Mr. Rodd, is an unsatisfactory
performance. The version is bald and spiritless, and some of the
best passages of the original are rendered in language that does no
justice to the author's meaning. His style is so peculiar, so
allusive, and so full of metaphor and quotation, and the work is
luminous with "the sparks of so many sciences," that a good
translation is a desideratum.</p>
<p>I may inform your correspondent that one has lately been
prepared and is announced for publication, with a memoir of the
illustrious bishop. I may add that the <i>Philobiblon</i> has been
six times printed: the last edition, if I remember rightly, was by
Dr. James: but some old MS. copies of this remarkable treatise on
the Love of Books exist, with some of which the text used by the
translator should be collated. But, of the publication announced,
it would not become me to say anything more, as the biographer
is</p>

<h3>ETYMOLOGICAL QUERIES.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 153.)</h4>
<p>The very satisfactory replies of Mr. WAY to some of the Queries
of J. MN., given at p. 169-70., make us wish for more, which I
trust we shall have, should he be supplied with the context in
which the words occur; without which it is difficult <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>{204}</span> to
elucidate them fully. In the meantime, I venture a few suggestions
on some of the remaining words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the fever or the <i>berebarde</i>,"</p>
<p>"<i>Berbi</i>, O.F., chancre, dartre; a <i>boil, bubo</i>, or
<i>tetter</i>, commonly attendant upon pestilent fever. 'Correpta
fuit vehementissima febri. Subtus ejus axillis detectis quoque
<i>Bubonibus</i>, magnam duritiem ac timorem pr&aelig; se
ferentibus.'"&mdash;<i>Miraculi S. Francisci Solani, A.S.</i>, tom.
v., Julii, p. 909.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(See Bullein's <i>Dialogue bothe pleasant and pitiful, wherein
is a goalie regimente against the Fever Pestilence</i>, &amp;c.,
1578.)</p>
<p>"<i>Deale</i>," if an interjection (?), may possibly stand for
"<i>De&acirc;</i>," or "<i>Ouy De&acirc;</i>, Yes, truly! verily!"
&amp;c. (See Cotgrave in v. <i>De&acirc;</i>.)</p>
<p>"<i>Schunche away</i>".&mdash;To <i>shun</i> or <i>shunche</i>
is used for to <i>shove</i>, in Sussex. "I <i>shunched</i> him
away."</p>
<p>"Wear no iron, nor haircloth, nor <i>irspilles
felles</i>"&mdash;that is, no <i>skins having hard or bristly
hair</i> like that of goats.</p>
<p>"HIRCIPILUS, Durorum pilorum homines sicut
hirci."&mdash;<i>Festus</i>.</p>
<p>Here the context clearly leads to this interpretation.</p>
<p><i>Sabraz</i>, or <i>sabras</i>, is a <i>decoction</i> or
<i>infusion</i>. One of the numerous terms which the apothecaries
adopted from the Arabic, in which <i>shabra</i> is a drink.</p>
<p><i>Sabe</i>, in O.F.; <i>saba</i>, Ital., an inspissated juice
or decoction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Sabaricio</i>, a kind of strong drinke made of barley."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I doubt whether Ducange is right in explaining <i>sabrierium</i>
in the following passage, by <i>condimentum</i>, Gallic&egrave;
<i>saupiquet</i>. It most probably signified a beverage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In omnibus secundis feriis dent illis ova quatuor uniquique

<blockquote>

<p><i>Poker.</i>&mdash;Among the muniments of the corporation of
Bodmin is a certificate of the mayor and burgesses respecting the
claims of the inhabitants of the town to take wood in Dunmere Wood,
belonging to the Priory of Bodmin. The language of it seems to
throw light on the origin of the word <i>pocarius</i>, or
<i>poker</i>, which has been so often noticed and discussed.
(<i>Ant&egrave;</i>, Vol. i., pp. 185. 218. 236. 269. 281. 323.
369.) The passage also illustrates the <i>Hook or Crook</i>
privilege, which has been already satisfactorily explained. The
date is A.D. 1525:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We say, and for truth testify that the wood called Dynmure
Wood, was ever open and common to all burgesses and inhabitants of
Bodmin till now of late, as well for all manner kind of their
beasts to common therein, as to have their burden wood, to bear and
carry away upon their backs, of lop, crop, <i>hook</i>,
<i>crook</i>, and <i>bag</i> wood; ... always reserving to the

<p>(See the <i>Bodmin Register</i>, collected by the Rev. John
Wallis, of Bodmin, and printed at Bodmin, 1827-1838, p. 303.)</p>
<p>I presume that <i>bag wood</i> is such wood as can be cut with a
hook or crook, and bunched. In another nearly contemporary petition
(<i>Ibid.</i> p. 306.), the same identical privilege is described
by the townsmen as a right to lop and crop with a hook and crook,
and to carry away on their backs, and "none other ways." This
explains the former passage, and shows that the wood was probably
carried away on the back in a bag.</p>
<p>The woodward, who carried a bill for such purposes, would also
carry a bag, or <i>poke</i>, and might therefore be very
appropriately called a poker.</p>
<p>It will be seen in Halliwell's <i>Dictionary</i>, verb. "Bag"
and "Bagging," and in the <i>Hereford Glossary</i> (London, 1839),
verb. "Bag," that <i>bagging</i> is sometimes used to signify
cutting; and, more particularly, cutting for burning.</p>
<p>I mention this, because it may be thought pertinent <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>{205}</span> to the
present inquiry; but as this use of the word has been plausibly
supposed to be derived from the Welsh <i>Bach</i>, a hook, it seems
to have nothing to do with a <i>poke</i>.</p>

<p><i>Querela Cantabrigiensis</i> (Vol. ii., p. 168.).&mdash;J.M.B.
inquires whether anything is known of the <i>authorship</i> of the
<i>Querela Cantabrigiensis</i>? The tract in question appears to
have been "written by Bruno Ryves," the author of <i>Mercurius
Rusticus</i>, and some few other treatises, in connexion with which
it is commonly bound. Ryves is described by Watt as "a loyal
divine," who was "born in Dorsetshire," and "died 1677." His
<i>Querela</i> was first printed at Oxford in 1646. There was a
second edition in 1647.</p>
<p>In case J.M.B. do not himself intend to send out a new edition
of this tract, it is to be hoped that his Query may induce some one
else to do so. Indeed, a reprint of several similar pamphlets and
short treatises, belonging to the same period, might be brought out
with great advantage at this crisis. The series might begin
with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Answere of the Vice-Chancellour, the Doctors, both the
Proctors, and other the Heads of Houses in the Universitie of
Oxford:</p>
<p>"(Agreeable, undoubtedly, to the joint and uniforme opinion of
all the Deanes and Chapters, and all other the learned and obedient
Cleargy in the Church of England:)</p>
<p>"To the humble Petition of the Ministers of the Church of
England, desiring Reformation of certaine ceremonies and abuses of
the Church. At Oxford: Printed by Joseph Barnes, and are to be sold
in Paule's Church Yard, at the sign of the Crowne, by Simon
Waterson, 1603."</p>

<p class="author">J. Sansom.</p>
<p>"<i>One Bell</i>" (Vol ii., p. 166.)&mdash;In the sixth edition
of the <i>Book of the Church</i> (I <i>believe</i> references are
also given in all editions since the first), Southey gives us his
authority for this, "Strype's <i>Cranmer</i>, p. 266. (edition of
1694.)" The passage occurs in book ii. chap. 26.: "The Duke of
Somerset's death." I quote it from the reprint by the
Ecclesiastical History Society (vol. ii. p. 345.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He (Somerset) is generally charged for the great spoil of
churches and chapels; defacing ancient tombs and monuments, and
pulling down the bells in parish churches, and <i>ordering only one
bell in a steeple, as sufficient to call the people together</i>,
which set the commonalty almost into a rebellion."</p>

<p><i>Fabulous Account of the Lion</i> (Vol. ii., p.
142.).&mdash;Jarltzberg is right in supposing that this is given by
Philippe de Thaun. It is, however, of older date. Turner
(<i>History of England during the Middle Ages</i>, vol. iv. chap.
iv. p. 209.) gives part of a Latin version of it from the
"Physiologus" of a certain Theobald. The "Physiologus," which is in
substance the same as the "Bestiary" of Philippe de Thaun, occurs,
according to Mr. Turner's account of it, in MSS. of the eighth or
ninth century. Anglo-Saxon versions of "The Whale and the Panther"
are in the <i>Codex Exoniensis</i>. In the works of Hildebert, who
died Abp. of Tours 1134, a poem called "Physiologus" is printed,
which appears to be the same as that ascribed by Turner to
Theobald. The fable and application of the Lion are the same as
those given by Turner, with very trifling variations.</p>
<p>Among the poems ascribed to Abp. Hildebert is an "Epitaphum
Magistri Theobaldi," who, I conjecture, is the same Theobald as the
supposed author of the "Physiologus." It is rather long; but there
is nothing to identify Theobaldus except the word "Dervensis." What
place this indicates I know not.</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>In the <i>Opera Hildeberti</i> there occur some verses on the
symbols of the Evangelists. I subjoin them: though it is perhaps
hardly worth while to print any more on this subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ON THE SYMBOLS OF THE EVANGELISTS.</p>
<p>"Matth&aelig;um signat vir, bos Lucain, leo Marcum, Ales
discipulum qui sine sorde fuit.</p>
<p>"Matth&aelig;o species humana datur, quia scripto Indicat et
titulo quid Deus egit homo. Os vituli Lucam declarat, qui specialem
Materiam sumpsit de cruce, Christe tu&acirc;. Effigiat Marcum leo,

<p><i>Pomfret on the Thames</i> (Vol. ii., p. 56.).&mdash;In a
former number N. required to be informed where the Pons fractus, or
Pountfreyt super Thamis, was situate, from whence several documents
were dated by Edward II. This question has puzzled many learned
antiquaries, and I do not think has ever been properly resolved.
Both Pons fractus and Pountfreyt occur in Rymer's <i>Foedera</i>,
tomus iii., p. 904. Lond. 1706. If you will permit, I would hazard
the conjecture that it was Kingston Bridge. Till within the last
two centuries, the only bridges across the Thames were London and
Kingston; and the latter in the thirteenth century appears to have
been in a ruinous condition. And I find in <i>Rot. Litterar.
Clausar</i>. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id=
"page206"></a>{206}</span> anno 7 Hen. III. (A.D. 1223) memb. 4. p.
558. "de ponte de Kingeston," that Henry de St. Alban, and Matthew,
son of Geoffry de Kingston, are directed to repair the bridge, date
Wednesday, Aug. 9, 1223 and there is also a recurrence to the same
subject, memb. 15. p. 579., dated on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 1223. I
would therefore ask, with submission to those who may be better
informed, whether the bridge, though ordered to be repaired by
Henry III., may not have remained in such a dilapidated state in
the time of Edw. II., that it may then have been styled "Pons
fractus?"</p>

<p><i>Walrond Family</i> (Vol. ii., p. 134.).&mdash;Among my very
numerous Notes relating to the several families of this name, I
find only the following which appears likely to be of any interest
to your correspondent in connection with his Query.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mrs. Ureth, daughter of Lieut.-Col. Walrond, was married to
James Huish, Esq. of Sidbury, co. Devon, on the 25th July,
1684."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is probable that in so numerous a family there was more
than one colonel at that time. Your correspondent is, no doubt,
aware that Burke's <i>Landed Gentry</i> states the names of the
wife and children of Colonel Humphrey Walrond, and that the
monument of Humphrey Walrond, Esq., who died in 1580, in the church
of Ilminster, co. Somerset, exhibits his coat armour quartering
Polton, Fissacre, and Speke, and impaling Popham and another coat,
viz., Per fesse indented quarterly or and sable, in each quarter an
annulet counterchanged. This coat of arms I shall be glad if your
correspondent will enable me to assign to its proper family.</p>

<p><i>Armenian Language</i> (Vol. ii., p. 136.).&mdash;Jarltzberg
may refer to two works printed at the press of the Mechitaristican
Society at Venice; 1. <i>Quadro della Storia Letteraria di
Armenia</i>, 1829; and 2. <i>Quadro delle Opere di Vari Autori
anticamente tradotte in Armeno</i>, 1825. He may also, perhaps, be
interested by another little work, printed at the same place, 1825,
entitled, <i>A brief Account of the Mechitaristican Society,
founded on the Island of St. Lazaro</i>, by Alexander Goode; in
which work it is stated (p. 26.) that "by Lord Byron's assistance a
grammar of the Armenian and English languages was composed by the
Rev. Dr. Aucher;" and that "this reverend gentleman has likewise
compiled, with John Brand, Esq., of the University of Cambridge, a
dictionary of the Armenian and English languages."</p>
<p>All these works are in the writer's possession and shall be lent
to Jarltzberg if he wishes to see them, and is not able to find

<p><i>Richard Baxter's Descendants</i> (Vol. ii, p.
89.).&mdash;Your correspondent W.H.B., who wishes for information
respecting the descendants of the celebrated Richard Baxter,
describes him to have been a Northamptonshire man; now this
(supposing the Nonconformist divine of that name is meant) is a
mistake, for he was, according to his own account, a Shropshire
man. In a narrative of the most memorable passages of his life and
times, by himself, and published soon after his death under the
title of <i>Reliqui&aelig; Baxterian&aelig;</i>, 1696, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My father's name was Richard (the son of Richard) Baxter; his
habitation and estate at a village called Eaton Constantine, a mile
from the Wrekin Hill, and above half a mile from Severn River, and
five miles from Shrewsbury in Shropshire. A village most pleasantly
and healthfully situate. My mother's name was Beatrice, the
daughter of Richard Adeney of Rowton, a village near High Encall,
the Lord Newport's seat, in the same county. There I was born, A.D.
1615, on the 12th of November, being the Lord's Day, in the
morning, at the time of divine worship, and baptized at High Encall
the 19th day following: and there I lived from my parents with my
grandfather till I was near ten years of age, and then was taken
home."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was married on Sept. 10, 1662, to a Miss Charlton. They had
no children. The only descendant of Richard Baxter known to his
biographers, was his nephew, William Baxter, a person of
considerable attainments as a scholar and an antiquary. He was born
in Shropshire in 1650. He published several works, and kept an
academy for some years at Tottenham Cross, Middlesex, which he gave
up on being chosen master of Mercer's School, London, where he
continued for twenty years, and resigned a short time before his
death, which took place in 1723.</p>
<p>Baxter makes mention, at the close of his own Life and Times, of
one Richard Baxter, a Sabbatarian Anabaptist, and says of him,
"that he was sent to gaol for refusing the oath of allegiance, and
it went for current that it was I."</p>

"pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>{207}</span>
Van-Mildert, and the present occupant of the see, have taken the
signature of Dunelm. I think, therefore, J.G.N. is mistaken in
saying that the Bishops of Durham have assumed the French and Latin
signatures alternately.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>That the good service which the <i>English Historical
Society</i> has rendered to that branch of our national literature,
for the promotion of which it was instituted, is clearly
recognised, is shown by the fact, that of the small paper copies of
the Society's publications, many of the earlier volumes are now
entirely out of print. Of the six volumes of Mr. Kemble's
invaluable <i>Codex Diplomaticus</i>, a work alike honourable to
the patriotic zeal of the Society and to the profound learning of
its editor, the first two volumes are, we believe, no longer to be
procured. Good texts of our early chronicles, in an acceptable
form, have long been wanted. That want, the English Historical
Society is gradually supplying. Their last publication is now
before us. To Mr. Benjamin Williams, the editor of <i>La Chronique
de la Traison et Mort de Richard II., Roy d'Angleterre</i>, the
Society and the public is now indebted for <i>Henrici Quinti
Anglice Regis Gesta, cum Chronic&acirc; Neustri&aelig;
Gallic&egrave;, ab anno MCCCCXIV. ad MCCCCXXII.</i>, a volume
containing an account of the battle of Agincourt, one of those
mighty struggles, the result of which changed the face of Europe;
as well as a detailed narrative of Henry's second expedition to the
Continent, a subject passed over by historians with less attention
than it deserves. Mr. Williams' Preface gives a very interesting
notice of the MSS. which he has employed, and the points which they
serve to illustrate, and he has accompanied his text by a number of
useful and judicious notes.</p>
<p>A gentleman of Devonshire is preparing for publication a
Catalogue of the numerous published works which relate to the
History, Antiquities, Biography, Natural History, and Local
Occurrences of that county, and has already sufficient matter to
occupy upwards of seventy octavo pages in print, and would be glad
to receive notices of any rare books and tracts on those subjects
on the shelves of private libraries. A similar work is in
contemplation as to existing manuscripts, ancient and modern,
relating to the same county; any information respecting which will
be highly acceptable, and may be forwarded to Mr. William Roberts,
197. High Street, Exeter.</p>

<p>TESTIMONIAL TO DR. CONOLLY.&mdash;At a meeting held at 12. Old
Burlington Street, Saturday, August 3d, 1850, the Right Hon. Lord
Ashley in the chair; the following resolutions among others were
unanimously agreed to:</p>
<p>That Dr. John Conolly, of Hanwell, is, in the opinion of this
meeting, eminently entitled to some public mark of esteem and
gratitude, for his long, zealous, disinterested, and most
successful labours in ameliorating the treatment of the insane.</p>
<p>That a committee be now formed, for the purpose of carrying into
effect the foregoing Resolution, by making the requisite
arrangements for the presentation to Dr. Conolly of <i>A Public
Testimonial</i>, commemorative of his invaluable services in the
cause of humanity, and expressive of the just appreciation of those
services by his numerous friends and admirers, and by the public
generally.</p>
<p>The Committee subsequently resolved:</p>
<p>That in the opinion of the committee, the most appropriate
Testimonial will be a Portrait of Dr. Conolly (for which he is
requested to sit), to be presented to his family, and an Engraving
of the same, to be presented to the subscribers; and that the
ultimate arrangement of this latter point be made at a future
meeting of the committee.</p>
<p>It has been determined that the individual subscriptions shall
be limited to Five Guineas; that subscribers of Two Guineas and
upwards shall receive a proof impression of the Engraving; and
subscribers of One Guinea, a print.</p>
<p>It is also proposed to present Dr. Conolly with a piece of
plate, should the funds permit after defraying the expenses of the
painting and engraving.</p>
<p>Subscribers' names and subscriptions will be received by the
secretaries, at 12. Old Burlington Street, and 4. Burlington
Gardens, and by the Treasurers, at the Union Bank, Regent Street
Branch, Argyll Place, London. Post-office Orders should be made

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
